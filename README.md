# Machine Learning Project
## 🪨📄✂️ Rock-Paper-Scissors Image Classification with CNN

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model developed to classify hand gesture images from the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game. It is a university project focused on applying machine learning best practices, including preprocessing, training, evaluation, and optional generalization testing.

---

### 🎯 Objectives

- Build a CNN to classify images as Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- Apply sound practices in:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model training and validation
  - Hyperparameter tuning
  - Model evaluation and interpretation
- Test generalization on custom images of personal hand gestures.
