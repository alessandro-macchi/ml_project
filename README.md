# Machine Learning Project
# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using SVM & Logistic Regression (from scratch)

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements two classic binary classification algorithms, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **Logistic Regression (LR)**, from scratch to predict wine quality. The task is to classify wines as either "good" (quality ≥ 6) or "bad" (quality < 6) using both red and white wine data.

The models are developed with careful attention to sound machine learning methodology, including data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation, and performance evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset

The Wine Quality dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes physicochemical tests of various wines, both red and white. The goal is to predict wine quality as a binary classification problem.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore and preprocess the wine dataset, preparing it for model training.  
- Implement Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine algorithms from scratch.  
- Extend both models using kernel methods to handle non-linear classification boundaries.  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning with automatic techniques such as grid search combined with 5-fold cross-validation.  
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Analyze misclassified samples and discuss model behavior including underfitting/overfitting.
